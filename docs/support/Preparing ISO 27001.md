Preparing for an ISO 27001 certification, which is a specification for an information security management system (ISMS), is a significant task for a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). In this context, the primary duties and responsibilities of the CISO include:

1.  **Setting Security Policies and Procedures:** The CISO is responsible for creating, implementing, and managing the organization's security policies and procedures that are aligned with ISO 27001 standards. These include policies for data access, usage, storage, and transmission. These policies must be detailed, clear, and enforceable.

2.  **Risk Assessment:** Conducting a comprehensive risk assessment is crucial in the ISO 27001 process. The CISO must identify all assets, threats, vulnerabilities, impacts, and the likelihood of occurrence to calculate the risk. They must also provide appropriate mitigation strategies.

3.  **Security Awareness Training:** The CISO must ensure that all staff are aware of the security policies and trained in security best practices. They must conduct regular training sessions and drills to ensure that the staff can identify security threats and understand their responsibilities to prevent security breaches.

4.  **Regular Audits:** Conducting regular audits is essential to measure the effectiveness of security controls. The CISO must ensure that audits are carried out at regular intervals and any non-compliance found during audits is addressed promptly.

5.  **Incident Management:** The CISO needs to establish and manage the incident response process. This involves creating an incident response team, developing a response plan, testing the plan, and conducting a post-incident review to identify areas for improvement.

6.  **Continuous Improvement:** The CISO should ensure that the ISMS is continuously improved through the use of metrics, audits, management reviews, and other feedback mechanisms. This means keeping up-to-date with the latest threats, vulnerabilities, and best practices in the field of information security.

7.  **Liaison with External Parties:** The CISO should also act as a point of contact during the ISO 27001 certification audit. They need to ensure that the external auditors have all the necessary information and can freely perform their tasks.

8.  **Management Reviews:** The CISO needs to present reviews to the top management, showcasing the performance of the ISMS, its effectiveness, and any changes in the risk environment or business operations.

9.  **Ensuring Legal and Contractual Compliance:** The CISO must ensure that the company complies with all relevant legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements. This includes data protection laws, cybersecurity laws, and any specific contractual obligations with clients or third parties.


By adhering to these duties, the CISO plays a crucial role in ensuring that the organization can meet the requirements of the ISO 27001 standard, thus demonstrating to clients and partners its commitment to information security.
