# Compliance Audits and External Communications

`2023.1`

CloudCore may be requested occasionally to share additional details regarding its
compliance, privacy and security program by an external entity such as a
customer, media, legal or law enforcement.  Such external communication, beyond
what is already publicly published, needs to comply with the following policies
and procedures.

## Policy Statements

CloudCore policy requires that:

(a) CloudCore operations must comply with all applicable laws,
regulations, security standards and frameworks. External audits shall be
conducted accordingly to each applicable compliance requirement.

  - HIPAA/HITECH. CloudCore must comply with all requirements listed
    in the HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996)
    and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health
    (HITECH) Act.





(b) All external communications related to compliance and customer/employee
privacy must follow pre-established procedures and handled by approved
personnel. This includes but is not limited to distribution of audit reports,
assessment results, incidents and breach notification.

(c) Audit and compliance reports may be shared with an external party only when
under signed NDA and approved by CloudCore Security and/or Privacy Officer.



## Controls and Procedures


### Compliance Program Management

CloudCore management and security/compliance team has identified and
regularly reviews all relevant statutory, regulatory, and contractual
requirements.

CloudCore's compliance policy includes requirements to meet any and
all applicable compliance requirements.

Additionally, the Vendor Risk Management policies and procedures specify the
details related to contractual agreements with clients, partners and vendors,
as well as requirements and process related to intellectual property rights and
the use of proprietary software products.

### Requesting Audit and Compliance Reports

CloudCore, at its sole discretion, shares audit reports, including
any Corrective Action Plans (CAPs) and exceptions, with customers on a case by case
basis. All audit reports are shared under explicit NDA in CloudCore format
between CloudCore and party to receive materials. Audit reports can be requested
by CloudCore workforce members for Customers or directly by CloudCore Customers.

The following process is used to request audit reports:

1. A request may be sent by email to
   [compliance@cloudcore.serveur.au](mailto:compliance@cloudcore.serveur.au)
   or by submitting a request via CloudCore Internal Support Portal
   or Email. In the request, please specify the type of report being requested
   and any required timelines for the report.
2. An Issue with the details of the request into the CloudCore Security Project
   on , which is used to track requests status and outcomes.
3. CloudCore security team will confirm if a current NDA is in place with the
   party requesting the audit report. If there is no NDA in place, CloudCore will
   send one for execution.
4. Once it has been confirmed that an NDA is executed, CloudCore staff will move
   the  Issue to "Under Review".
5. The CloudCore Security Officer or Privacy Officer must Approve or Reject the
   Issue. If the Issue is rejected, CloudCore will notify the requesting party
   that we cannot share the requested report.
4. If the Issue has been Approved, CloudCore will send the customer the requested
   audit report and complete the  Issue for the request.

See detailed policy and procedures in [Breach Notification](breach.md)

#### External Audits of Information Access and Activity

Prior to contracting with an external audit firm, CloudCore shall:

* Outline the audit responsibility, authority, and accountability
* Choose an audit firm that is independent of other organizational operations
* Ensure technical competence of the audit firm staff
* Require the audit firm's adherence to applicable codes of professional ethics
* Assign organizational responsibility for supervision of the external audit
  firm
* Obtain a signed HIPAA business associate agreement, if any ePHI will be shared/accessed during the audit

Whenever possible, a third party auditing vendor should not be providing the
organization IT oversight services (e.g., vendors providing IT services should
not be auditing their own services to ensure separation of duties).
